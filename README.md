# starterlog-theme

Welcome to the Starter Log Jekyll theme!

This minimalist theme for technical writing and ranting was handcrafted by the Hobbyists at Copyleft.io so that we could share our inner daemons :)  We've open sourced it so that others may also use if for personal and professional projects.

## License

The theme is available as open source under the terms of the [MPL-2.0 License](https://opensource.org/licenses/MPL-2.0).

### Dependencies

Ruby Version = 2.3.0p0
Bundler Version 1.12.5
Jekyll Version = 3.2.1


### Getting Started

To demo and experiment with this code, simply install the dependencies and clone the project to your local workspace.  Run `bundle install` to pull in any gem dependencies and then run `jekyll serve` â€“ this directory is setup just like a Jekyll site!


### Installation

To use this theme in your existing Jekyll project... Add this line to your Jekyll site's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem "starterlog-theme"
```

And add this line to your Jekyll site:

```yaml
theme: starterlog-theme
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install starterlog-theme

## Usage

The Starter Log Theme is great for personal and professional projects.  It provides a custom boostrap theme and color scheme, layouts, includes, static pages, assets, and lunr search functionality that you can use to build out a fully functional jekyll project that compliments your technical writing...

Core components such as bootstrap, font-awesome, jquery, and lunr.js were used to develop the theme, and make it very simple to extend and build upon.

## Development

To set up your environment to develop this theme, run `bundle install`.

You theme is setup just like a normal Jelyll site! To test your theme, run `jekyll serve` and open your browser at `http://localhost:4000`. This starts a Jekyll server using your theme. Add pages, documents, data, etc. like normal to test your theme's contents. As you make modifications to this theme and to your content, your site will regenerate and you should see the changes in the browser after a refresh, just like normal.
